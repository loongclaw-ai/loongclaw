# Internal Integration Quickstart

Use this guide when you are adding or evolving a repository-owned surface in
LoongClaw.

## Start Here

Read:

- [Internal Integration SDK Contract](../design-docs/internal-integration-sdk-contract.md)
- [SDK Strategy](../design-docs/sdk-strategy.md)

## Family Starting Points

| Family | Primary code seam | Primary contract doc |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Channels | `crates/app/src/channel/sdk.rs`, `crates/app/src/channel/registry.rs` | [Channel Registry Integration Contract](../design-docs/channel-registry-integration-contract.md) |
| Tools | `crates/app/src/tools/catalog.rs`, `crates/app/src/tools/mod.rs` | [SDK Strategy](../design-docs/sdk-strategy.md) |
| Providers | `crates/app/src/config/provider.rs`, `crates/app/src/provider/contracts.rs`, `crates/app/src/provider/mod.rs` | [Provider SDK Convergence Plan](../plans/2026-03-29-provider-sdk-convergence-implementation-plan.md) |
| Memory systems | `crates/app/src/memory/system_registry.rs` | [Internal Integration SDK Contract](../design-docs/internal-integration-sdk-contract.md) |

## Maintainer Flow

1. Start from the family-owned seam instead of scattered call sites.
2. Declare canonical identity once.
3. Attach validation and support facts beside the seam.
4. Implement runtime behavior after the descriptor or contract is clear.
5. Project through shared surfaces such as config, doctor, status, catalog, or
   docs.
6. Add family-specific conformance tests.
7. Update docs using the same canonical vocabulary.

## Practical Checklist

- [ ] I started from the family-owned seam.
- [ ] The surface has one canonical identity.
- [ ] Validation and support facts live beside the descriptor or contract.
- [ ] Runtime behavior consumes shared metadata instead of redefining it.
- [ ] Operator surfaces derive from the same family metadata where practical.
- [ ] Conformance or regression tests were added or extended.
